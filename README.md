The sales department has reported that ticket sales have fluctuated drastically and as a part of finding out the reason for changes in sales, the data team is analysing data from different domains. One of the team is analysing the customer review collected from the website. Data from earlier years were stored in an on-premise system and recent data are stored in DynamoDb.
